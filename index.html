<h4><b>Jan08 2023 - New Stable Minor Release 0.4.7</b></h4>
<hr>
  <list>  
    <li>AI improvements for economy, especially managing parallel economies around Stocks</li>
    <li>AI improvements to attack logic, it is much more conservative now.  Previously it was foolishly aggressive</li>
    <li>Fixed resource production graphs, they are working great now</li>
    <li>Elimination of long-snaking grass paths across water bodies (see https://github.com/freeserf/freeserf/issues/519)</li>
    <li>Added new reeds/cattails in water (optional)</li>
    <li>Added map generator sliders specific to WaterTrees and WaterStones now that they are fixed (they were broken in original game)</li>
    <li>Map Generator options persist to disk</li>
    <li>New larger submerged stones based on partial loading of existing junk objects from land</li>
    <li>Tweaked water splashes around water stones</li>
    <li>Improved water road contrast with option_WaterDepthLuminosity</li>
    <li>Improved AI castle placement logic, though human-player-with-FogOfWar-on placement is unchanged</li>
    <li>Added pathfinding check to free-walking behaviors to prevent Knights (on attack) and Serfs (when fishing, chopping, farming, planting) from trying to walk around excessively large bodies of water</li>
    <li>Building sounds now have ambient focus area of around 800x600 pixels instead of entire screen, to reduce noise when playing at high resolutions</li>
    <li>Fixes for root cause of stuck-serf in StateWaitIdleOnPath issues.   Previously the AI would work around these by booting stuck serfs, but this resulted in the serfs not reaching their destination and a replacement never called, sometimes causing buildings to never be completed/occupied</li>
    <li>Tweaks to dulling of sprites in winter with FourSeasons on</li>

<h3>Overview</h3>  
Forkserf is an open-source improved-clone of the original Settlers (EU) / Serf City (US) game by Blue Byte software.  Forkserf was forked in 2020 from <a href="https://github.com/freeserf">FreeSerf</a> by JonLS and wicked_digger.  It is written in C/C++ and published under GPL3+ license.
<h3>Why play Forkserf?</h3>
Forkserf was created to improve the "single-player versus AI in random games" aspect of the original game.  This is done by completely rewriting a new AI from scratch, fixing bugs, and addition of optional features to make the game more balanced and interesting.  Also, as far as I know, FreeSerf (and as a result, Forkserf) is the only implementation that allows playing both DOS and Amiga versions in one binary.
<h3>Why <i>not</i> play Forkserf?</h3>
If you are looking for an authentic reproduction of the <i>original game AI</i>, single-player Missions, and multiplayer(!), I suggest you try nicymike's <a href="https://serflings.simpleguide.net/">Serflings</a>.
Or, find the original game and run it in <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/">DosBox</a>, it works perfectly - though Serflings is smoother.  I don't know how to run the orginal Amiga version, though.
Or, try one of the official (UbiSoft?) remakes though I have read they are worse than the original game because they introduce bugs, limit features, change some game logic?  not sure
<h3>Forkserf Requires the Original Game Content Files</h3>
For copyright reasons, the original DOS and Amiga game data cannot be included in this distribution and so you must provide your own copy.  These can be found in the original game install directories, and on various abandonware sites.

<h3>Known Limitations</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Update - missions disabled until fixed ~~single player Missions from original game are included but not playtested~~, I only play random games</li>
  <li>MacOS builds will eventually be provided but not playtested, I don't have a Mac</li>
  <li>Windows8/10/11+ builds provided but not playtested, I only have Windows7</li>
  <li>No multiplayer, and no immediate plans for multiplayer</li>
  <li>the original game Character personalities are not yet implemented, all AI players use same improved AI.  Personalities will be added soon</li>
  <li>combat playtesting and AI combat logic is primitive.  It works fine but I haven't paid as much attention to it as the economy part</li>
  <li>occasional crash bugs, but it is quite stable for me.  Crash bugs are top priority to fix.  I suggest using AutoSave feature just in case</li>
  <li>the AI does not use the Geologist Estimates for castle placement, this has always felt like cheating to me and I do not use it myself.  At some point I may add this as a selectable feature</li>
  <li>I believe the Amiga terrain graphics are messed up.  I assumed this is how they always looked as I had never played the Amiga original.  This isn't something I can fix, it is untouched from Freeserf</li>
</ul>
<h3>Future Plans and Possibilities</h3>
  <li>implement AI Character personalities, so they behave uniquely.  At the very least have aggressive, defensive, preferences for food types</li>
  <li>OPTIONAL overhauled pig farming, with pannage (i.e. pig foraging) where pigs eat acorns from nearby oak trees in autumn instead of being fed grain</li>
  <li>OPTIONAL snow and rain effects.  It is easy to make snow on the ground by switching the tiles to Tundra, but buildings need snow and falling snow weather effects would be nice, same with rain</li>
  <li>OPTIONAL knight promotion and combat overhaul,.  Intent is to make rank matter more and gold stored matter less, and maybe tie knight promotion to gold/meat availability</li>
  <li>OPTIONAL random events & special encounters, like Fallout, CrusaderKings</li>
  <li>OPTIONAL overhauled serf reproduction logic, possibly including female serfs, babies, etc.</li>
  <li>OPTIONAL churches, and serf happiness/morale</li
  <li>in-game advisors, like old civ games had</li>
</ul>
<h3>Contributing</h3>
If you would like to participate in the project, contact me on discord (as tlongstretch), or on github (as tlongstretch), or email tlongstretch5151@gmail.com.  Also,   I can usually be found squatting in the Serflings discord channel, I don't have a Forkserf channel because as far as I know I'm the only one playing it
<h3>Help with Build Issues?</h3>
I am not really much of a developer, I am a linux sysadmin by trade.  I have only limited knowledge of CMake, Visual Studio, vcpkg, SDL2, etc.  I will help if I can but don't expect much
<h3>What about FreeSerf?</h3>
I am hoping that jonls and wdigger will resume work on their project one day.  I still hear from wdigger occasionally but jonls seems to be long gone.  I have been submitting all fixes for proven bugs I find in FreeSerf to their project
