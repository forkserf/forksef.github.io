  <h1>Overview</h1>  
  Forkserf is an open-source improved-clone of the original Settlers (EU) / Serf City (US) game by Blue Byte software.  Forkserf was forked from <a href="https://github.com/freeserf">FreeSerf</a> by JonLS and wicked_digger.  It is written in C/C++ and published under GPL3+ license.
  <h1>Why Forkserf?</h1>
  Forkserf was created to improve the "single-player versus AI" gameplay of the original game.  This is done by completely rewriting the original AI from scratch, fixing bugs, and addition of optional features to make the game more balanced and interesting.  Also, as far as I know, FreeSerf is the only implementation that allows playing both DOS and Amiga versions in one binary.
  <h1>Why *not* Forksef</h1>
  If you are looking for an authentic reproduction of the <i>original</i> game AI, single-player Missions, and multiplayer(!), I suggest you try nicymike's <a href="https://serflings.simpleguide.net/">Serflings</a>
  Or, buy the original game or find on abandonware and run in DosBox, it works perfectly.  I don't know how to run the orginal Amiga version, though.
  Or, try one of the official (UbiSoft?) remakes though I have read they are worse than the original game because they introduce bugs, limit features, change some game logic?  not sure
  <h1>Requires original game content files</h1>
  For copyright reasons, the original DOS and Amiga game data cannot be included in this distribution and so you must provide your own copy.  These can be found in the original game install directories, and on various abandonware sites.
  <h1>Improvements over FreeSerf & original Serf City / Settlers game</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>advanced AI for enemy players (FreeSerf has no AI at all!</li>
      <li>fixes for numerous bugs, including game-breaking bugs</li>
      <li>custom Map Generator</li>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
      <li>more debugging tools, including overlays for highlighting AI logic</li>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Known Limitations</h1>
    <ul>
    <li>single player Missions from original game are included by not playtested, I only play random games</li>
    <li>MacOS builds provided but not playtested, I don't have a Mac</li>
    <li>Windows8+ builds provided but not playtested, I only have Windows7</li>
    <li>No multiplayer, and no immediate plans for multiplayer</li>
    <li>the original game Character personalities are not yet implemented, all AI players use same improved AI.  Personalities will be added soon</li>
    <li>combat playtesting and AI combat logic is primitive.  It works fine but I haven't paid as much attention to it as the economy part</li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Future Plans</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>improved AI attack logic</li>
    <li>implement AI Character personalities, so they behave uniquely</li>
    <li>OPTIONAL overhauled pig farming, with pannage (i.e. pig foraging) where pigs eat acorns from nearby oak trees in autumn instead of being fed grain</li>
    <li>OPTIONAL snow and rain effects.  It is easy to make snow on the ground by switching the tiles to Tundra, but buildings need snow and falling snow weather effects would be nice, same with rain</li>
    <li>OPTIONAL knight promotion and combat overhaul,.  Intent is to make rank matter more and gold stored matter less, and maybe tie knight promotion to gold/meat availability</li>
